"""Slide and deck linter — detects layout/typographic issues on generated slides.

Public entry point::

    report = slide.lint()              # SlideLintReport
    report.issues                      # list[LintIssue]

Issue types:

* ``TextOverflow``             — text likely exceeds the text-frame bounds.
* ``ShapeCollision``           — two shapes' bounding boxes overlap.
* ``OffSlide``                 — a shape extends outside the slide.
* ``MinFontSize``              — a text run is below the legibility threshold.
* ``OffGridDrift``             — shape is slightly off a column/row grid that
  several siblings hit cleanly.
* ``LowContrast``              — text/background contrast is below WCAG AA.
* ``ZOrderAnomaly``            — a filled card-shaped backdrop is drawn above
  shapes it visually contains.
* ``MasterPlaceholderCollision`` — a shape sits exactly on a placeholder it
  should likely have inherited from the layout.

          inside the bounds.  Each shape is clamped at most once even
          when it triggered multiple OffSlide issues (e.g. left + right).
        * ``OffGridDrift`` — snaps the shape's drifted edge onto the dominant
          grid line (Tier 3 of the auto-fix tier list).
        * ``TextOverflow`` — flips the offending text frame's auto-size
          setting to ``MSO_AUTO_SIZE.TEXT_TO_FIT_SHAPE`` so PowerPoint
          shrinks the runs at render time.  This is a non-destructive

          render-time sizing changes.  Frames that already have a
          non-NONE auto-size are skipped (they should not have linted
          in the first place).

        Not auto-fixable:

        * ``ShapeCollision`` — nudging shapes apart almost always breaks intent;
          tag intentional overlaps with ``shape.lint_group`` to suppress.

    *include_effect_bleed* is opt-in (default ``False``): when ``True``
    the :class:`OffSlide` and :class:`ShapeCollision` detectors widen
    each shape's bbox by its shadow blur radius before checking
    geometry.  Bleed-only triggers come back as :class:`OffSlideShadow`
    / :class:`ShapeCollisionShadow` so callers can opt them out
    separately via ``shape.lint_skip``.

    *disable* is an iterable of issue ``code`` values to skip entirely
    — e.g. ``disable=["ShapeCollision", "OffGridDrift"]`` silences both
    rules deck-wide.  ``ShapeCollisionShadow`` and ``OffSlideShadow``
    are *not* implied by their non-shadow base codes; pass them
    explicitly.

    *min_severity* drops issues below the named threshold from the
    report.  Accepts a :class:`LintSeverity` member or a case-insensitive
    string (``"info"``, ``"warning"``, ``"error"``).  The default
    ``"info"`` keeps everything.

    Returns a :class:`SlideLintReport` with the detected issues.
