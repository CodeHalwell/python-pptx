.. _lint:

Layout linter
=============

|pp| includes a read-only inspector that reports geometric and typographic
issues on a slide.  It is designed for scripts that generate slides
programmatically — most usefully for LLM-driven generators that
occasionally produce overflowing text or off-slide shapes.

Running the linter
------------------

::

    report = slide.lint()
    report.issues          # list[LintIssue]
    report.has_errors      # bool
    print(report.summary())

For a whole deck, iterate the slides yourself::

    all_issues = []
    for slide in prs.slides:
        all_issues.extend(slide.lint().issues)

The :func:`power_pptx.compose.from_spec` entry point also accepts a
deck-level ``"lint": "warn" | "raise"`` field that walks every slide
and surfaces issues for you.

Issue types
-----------

* :class:`power_pptx.lint.TextOverflow` — estimated text extent exceeds the
  text-frame extent.  The current 1.1 implementation uses a fast
  character/line-count heuristic (default character width of
  ``0.55 × pt``, line height of ``1.2 × pt``) and respects text-frame
  margins; shapes with ``auto_size`` set to ``TEXT_TO_FIT_SHAPE`` or
  ``SHAPE_TO_FIT_TEXT`` are skipped because they cannot overflow by
  definition.  A Pillow-driven measurement pass is on the roadmap.
* :class:`power_pptx.lint.OffSlide` — a shape is wholly or partly outside the
  slide bounds.
* :class:`power_pptx.lint.ShapeCollision` — two shapes' bounding boxes overlap
  significantly.  See :ref:`lint-groups` for how to suppress collisions that
  reflect intentional layering.
* :class:`power_pptx.lint.MinFontSize` — a text run is below the configured
  legibility threshold (default 9pt).
* :class:`power_pptx.lint.OffGridDrift` — a shape's left or top edge is
  slightly off a dominant column/row that several other shapes hit cleanly.
  Auto-fixable: :meth:`SlideLintReport.auto_fix` snaps the drifted edge onto
  the grid.
* :class:`power_pptx.lint.LowContrast` — text and resolved background fill
  have a WCAG contrast ratio below 4.5:1.  Resolves only solid RGB fills
  (theme colors and gradients are skipped silently to avoid false
  positives).
* :class:`power_pptx.lint.ZOrderAnomaly` — a filled shape is drawn above a
  shape it visually contains, hiding the inner shape at render time.
* :class:`power_pptx.lint.MasterPlaceholderCollision` — a non-placeholder
  shape sits at exactly the position of a layout placeholder it should
  likely have inherited from instead of redrawing.

Each issue carries a ``severity`` (:class:`~power_pptx.lint.LintSeverity`),
a ``code`` string, a human-readable ``message``, and a ``shapes``
tuple of the shapes it implicates.

Auto-fix
--------

Some issues can be repaired without designer judgment::

    fixes = report.auto_fix()              # mutates; returns list[str]
    preview = report.auto_fix(dry_run=True)

Currently auto-fixable:

* ``OffSlide`` — translates the shape so it sits inside the slide
  bounds.

Not auto-fixable in 1.1:

* ``TextOverflow`` — requires designer judgment on font size vs
  content.  Use ``text_frame.fit_text(...)`` (which measures with
  Pillow font metrics and bakes a fitting size into the XML) or set
  ``text_frame.auto_size = MSO_AUTO_SIZE.TEXT_TO_FIT_SHAPE`` to let
  PowerPoint shrink at render time.
* ``ShapeCollision`` — auto-nudging shapes apart almost always breaks
  the design.

.. _lint-groups:

Suppressing intentional overlaps with ``lint_group``
----------------------------------------------------

A bare collision check is unusable on decks with intentional layering: a
KPI card with an accent bar and overlaid text generates four "collision"
warnings every time you stamp it.  The fix is to label shapes whose
overlap is by design.

The grouping rule:

* shapes that share the same non-empty ``lint_group`` are allowed to
  overlap (no warning);
* shapes with no group, or shapes in different groups, still warn on
  overlap.

Three equivalent ways to tag::

    # 1. Tag at construction time
    card.lint_group = "kpi-card-1"

    # 2. Batch
    slide.lint_group("kpi-card-1", card, accent_bar, label_box, value_box)

    # 3. Context manager — auto-tags every shape added in the block
    with slide.design_group("kpi-card-1"):
        slide.shapes.add_shape(MSO_SHAPE.RECTANGLE, ...)   # card
        slide.shapes.add_shape(MSO_SHAPE.RECTANGLE, ...)   # accent
        slide.shapes.add_textbox(...)                       # label
        slide.shapes.add_textbox(...)                       # value

The ``design_group`` form is recommended for slide-recipe helpers like
``add_kpi_card(...)``: wrap the helper body and every shape it creates
inherits the group automatically.  Nested ``design_group`` calls are
honored (innermost name wins), and an explicit ``shape.lint_group =
"..."`` inside the block is never overwritten.

The tag is stored as a custom-namespaced attribute on the shape's
``p:cNvPr`` element, so it round-trips through ``power-pptx`` save/load.
PowerPoint ignores the unknown namespace, so the tag has no visual or
semantic effect on the deck — it is metadata for the linter only.

Cross-group collisions still warn, e.g. a KPI card overlapping a panel
on another track is flagged as expected.

Recommended pattern for generators
----------------------------------

::

    from power_pptx.exc import LintError

    prs = build_deck_from_user_input(...)

    # 1. Auto-fix what we can (currently: nudge OffSlide shapes back in)
    for slide in prs.slides:
        slide.lint().auto_fix()

    # 2. Re-run and bail on any remaining errors
    remaining: list = []
    for slide in prs.slides:
        remaining.extend(
            i for i in slide.lint().issues
            if i.severity.value == "error"
        )
    if remaining:
        raise LintError("; ".join(str(i) for i in remaining))

    prs.save("out.pptx")

When building through :func:`power_pptx.compose.from_spec`, the
``"lint": "raise"`` field on the spec dict does the same thing in
fewer lines.
